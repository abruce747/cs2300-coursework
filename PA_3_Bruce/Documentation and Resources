Part 1:
		Files, readers, writers, and matrices set up in constructor
	and helper method. Calculations and file writing handled in 
	do_tasks method. Helper methods used to write the results to the
	output file and to the console for testing. 

Part 2:
		Files and related objects set up in constructor with a helper
	method to load the file's data into matrices. Further methods calculate 
	coefficient and constant of y=mx+b equation. Within the display_charts()
	method an instance of the PlotExample class was made for displaying the
	graph with points and a line of best fit. Helper methods were used to 
	find and send data for the PlotExample instance (mostly for sizing the
	line and displaying textual information). Other helper methods write
	the equation to the output file and write the matrices and equation to
	the console for easier testing.
	
PlotExample (extends ApplicationFrame):
		A scatter plot and a line chart were created, their datasets were
	loaded with helper methods from the matrices and equation components
	in the constructor, and the two charts were layered into the renderer
	for a mater chart to use, as line charts and scatter plots are entirely
	separate object types. This was more difficult than was necessary, but
	I thought that I should try to get a simple line to appear first in 
	order to better understand the JFreeChart library. Helper methods 
	print the data to console for testing.
